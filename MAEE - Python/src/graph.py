    1. Infrastructure & Networking: All API Gateways, Load Balancers, CDN, Firewalls, DNS routing, and VPC details shown.
    2. Compute & Microservices: Every service/application block. Note if they are serverless, containerized, event-driven, or monolithic.
    3. Data Storage: Databases (SQL/NoSQL/Graph), Caches (Redis/Memcached), Message Queues/Brokers (Kafka/RabbitMQ), and Object Stores (S3).
    4. Interactions & Data Flow: Describe the directional arrows. What talks to what? Is it synchronous (REST/gRPC) or asynchronous? 
    5. Missing obvious components: Note any immediate missing foundational elements (e.g., "There is no load balancer in front of the 5 web servers").

    Extracted Architectural Components (from visual diagram):
    {state['extracted_design']}
    
    Evaluation Instructions:
    1. Score the architecture out of a maximum of 80 points based strictly on these dimensions:
       - Scalability (20 pts): Can it handle 10x traffic spikes? Are there bottlenecks?
       - Fault Tolerance & Reliability (20 pts): Are there single points of failure (SPOF)? What happens if a DB goes down?
       - Data Management (20 pts): Is the choice of SQL/NoSQL appropriate? Is caching utilized properly? Is data consistency addressed?
       - Overall Suitability (20 pts): Does the architecture directly solve the user's specific "Problem Statement"?
       
    2. Identify Critical Weaknesses & Edge Cases: Formulate 20 hyper-specific, realistic production edge cases that this specific architecture fails to handle correctly. (e.g., "Cache stampede on the user-metadata Redis cluster upon regional failover").

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Keep the `feedback` string concise (under 4 sentences) to prevent JSON cutoffs.
    - ESCAPE all internal double quotes inside your string values using backslashes.

    Output MUST be strictly in the following JSON format:
